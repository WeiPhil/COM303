    "In this notebook we will explore the potential advantages of digital transmission over analog transmission. We will consider the case of transmission over a long (e.g. transoceanic) cable in which several repeaters are used to compensate for the attenuation introduced by the transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that if each cable segment introduces an attenuation of $1/G$, we can recover the original amplitude by boosting the signal with a repeater with gain $G$. However, if the signal has accumulated additive noise, the noise will be amplified as well so that, after $N$ repeaters, the noise will have been amplified $N$ times:\n",

    "If we use a digital signal, on the other hand, we can threshold the signal after each repeater and virtually eliminate the noise at each stage, so that even after several repeaters the trasmission is still noise-free."
